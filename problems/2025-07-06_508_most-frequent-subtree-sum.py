# LeetCode 508: Most Frequent Subtree Sum
# Date: 2025-07-06
# Difficulty: Medium
# Topics: Hash Table, Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree

'''
Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.
The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).
 
Example 1:


Input: root = [5,2,-3]
Output: [2,-3,4]

Example 2:


Input: root = [5,2,-5]
Output: [2]

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
