# LeetCode 3216: Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap
# Date: 2025-06-25
# Difficulty: Easy
# Topics: String, Greedy

'''
Given a string s containing only digits, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after swapping adjacent digits in s with the same parity at most once.
Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5 and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "45320"
Output: "43520"
Explanation: 
s[1] == '5' and s[2] == '3' both have the same parity, and swapping them results in the lexicographically smallest string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "001"
Output: "001"
Explanation:
There is no need to perform a swap because s is already the lexicographically smallest.

 
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of digits.
